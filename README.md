# Statistics without Borders x Painted Dogs Research Trust

This is the  Github repository for the collabation project between Statistics Without Borders (SWB) and Painted Dog Research Trust (PDRT).

The main goal of this repository is to show how to build a data pipeline that would allow PDRT to obtain easily insights from the data they collect on field.

The main assumption behind this repository is that the *data that will be used would look like the ones that are in the data folder** (provided by the PDRT team). 

This means that if the data collected by PDRT changes in structure (e.g. new column names) in the future the scripts provided here must be modified in order to run. However, the change should be minimal.

All scripts were written in Python (version 3.10.12) and therefore the user needs Python to be [installed on their machine](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

Moreover, in order to easily install all the needed libraries, the user might want to [install pip too](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
